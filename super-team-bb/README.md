## Technologies Utilized & Prerequiste:

Machine should have the following: 

[node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

Basic editor, for e.g. [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

Compass ``gem install compass``.

* This project is generated with [angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular).
 
* Grunt is used for building and deployment on local, and it is hosted on Bitbucket server.
 
* For creating a single page application, I have relied upon AngularJS.
 
* UI/UX are supported using BootStrap
 
* Google Maps api is used to display parking location.
 
* Used Sublime Text as IDE.

##Assumptions:
 * Login Page to support the login via email and pass, 'b@b.com' and 'b' respectively, which is stored in local storage.
 * Dashbaord page to show first 25 Parking Slots only
 * SpaceShort => slot for parking small Car
 * SpaceLong => slot for parking long Car
 * Grren State => shows Slot available
 * Show red state when application is not aware of any available parking slot
 * Red State => shows No Slot available as per the data.
 * map screen size is standard , which should fits users screen size.
 * The details page should show 
 * Available Short Spaces : [Available Short Spaces] / [Total Short Spaces]
 * Available Long Spaces : [Available Long Spaces] / [Total Long Spaces]
 * Map means geographical map.
 * Informal language is expected while communicating with users.
 * Available parking slots might change in between the user is on list page and when he goes on details page.
 * Most users use either of the following browsers
        * Chromium (Latest)
        * Firefox (Latest)
        * Safari (Latest)

##Improvements:

 * Pagination must be implemented.
 * Should handle calls via Intercetors
 * Images should be maintained in a Sprite instead.
 * The Map on details page is not responsive, It could be made responsive.
 * Error handling
 * Should implement loading effect in order to show the network latency
 * We can add some caching to improve performance

##Architecture:


***App.js***

 * This class serves as the initial router and modules manager for Angular App


***header.html***

 * This is the common view through out the app, having BACKBASE logo and the logout button, The common view is created via ui-view


***footer.html***

***MainCtrl***

 * Main Controller acts as the parent controller, It handles the logout, return to dashboard, logged in like functionalities. Function resides in this controller can be accessed through out the app via Classical Inheritance feature of scope in AngularJS

***login.html***

***commonFactory***

 * Main service of the application, which serves as the setters/getters of various values , also it fetches the data from API.

 * For more readability Documentation is also done , please refer to it, Angular  ng-docs is used for the purpose, can view via `` grunt serve:docs ``
